Tic Tac Toe Game

Description:

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with 'X' and 'O' symbols. The first player to have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

How to Play:

Players take turns clicking on empty spaces on the game board to place their symbol ('X' or 'O').
The game ends when one player achieves three in a row or when the board is full.
The winner is displayed at the bottom, and the score is tallied on the top.
Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
